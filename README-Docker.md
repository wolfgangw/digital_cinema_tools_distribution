## Digital Cinema Tools Distribution

Please see [Digital Cinema Tools Distribution](https://github.com/wolfgangw/digital_cinema_tools_distribution/wiki) for an introduction.

The DockerFile will install digital_cinema_tools_distribution, and to run it, start it in Interactive mode. IE:
```bash
docker run -ti -v /Volumes:/Volumes jaminmc/digital_cinema_tools_distribution
```

On a Mac, mounting `-v /Volumes:/Volumes` allows access to the drives that are not the OS drive to be able to check a DCP by just pasting `dcp_inspect [options] ` and drag the folder you want to check into the terminal.
