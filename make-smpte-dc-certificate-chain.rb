# Creates 3 related digital cinema compliant certificates as specified
# by SMPTE 430-2-2006 D-Cinema Operations -- Digital Certificate.
# Verifies root certificate -> intermediate -> leaf certificate relations
# and concatenates into a certificate chain.
#
# Requires ruby and openssl
#
# Proof of concept. In real-world applications private keys 
# would be protected with appropriate file permissions and
# passphrases to restrict access.
# Also they'd be part of a key- and certificate-handling
# infrastructure to allow for various intermediate and leaf 
# certificates and to enable the related tools to locate 
# keys and certificates.
#
# The script, in principle, does the same thing 3 times,
# once to create a root authority, then an intermediate
# authority and finally a leaf at the end of the branch:
#
#   a) Create a private/public key pair
#   b) define digital-cinema-specific properties of the corresponding, to-be-created certificate
#   c) Issue a request for signature (The request holds the public key component plus metadata)
#   d) Sign and thereby issue a signed certificate (self-signed in the case of the root certificate)
#
# The relation between 2 certificates is established in d)
#
# Intentionally no ruby-specific openssl bindings here,
# merely building shell calls to openssl.
#    - So why is this a ruby script then?
#    - Because I nearly broke my bones trying to properly quote 
#      the required dnq's in bash. Solutions much appreciated
#
# No directory and file checks here. Watch where you run it:
#
# $ mkdir certstore
# $ cd certstore
# $ make-dc-certificate-chain.rb # creates keys and certificates in the current directory
#
# Use leaf.key to sign files. For example:
# $ xmlsec --sign --privkey-pem leaf.key --trusted-pem intermediate.signed.pem --trusted-pem ca.self-signed.pem presigned_cpl.xml
# where presigned_cpl.xml is an XML Signature template, containing a 
# composition playlist, a signer fragment and a signature block,
# containing a signed info fragment and a signature value stub.
#
# See https://github.com/wolfgangw/digital_cinema_tools/blob/master/cinemaslides
# for proof-of-concept code to encrypt essence track files and generate KDMs,
# using these keys and certificates.
#
